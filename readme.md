##  How to Run Locally

1. First, clone the repository to your machine using `git clone`.
2. Go into the root folder and open two terminal windows/tabs â€” one for the backend and one for the frontend.
3. In the **server** folder:
   - Navigate to the `server` directory.
   - Run `npm install` to install all backend dependencies.
   - Then run `npm run dev` to start the backend server.
4. In the **client** folder:
   - Navigate to the `client` directory.
   - Run `npm install` to install all frontend dependencies.
   - Then run `npm run dev` to start the frontend React app.
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5173` to use the application locally.

Make sure MongoDB is running locally or adjust the connection string to your cloud instance (like MongoDB Atlas) if you're using one.

###  Environment Setup

Before running the app, make sure you create the following environment files:

#### `client/.env`

```env
VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key  
VITE_GOOGLE_PROJECTID=your_google_project_id  
VITE_GOOGLE_APP_ID=your_google_app_id  
VITE_GOOGLE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_google_auth_domain  
```

#### `server/.env`

```env
MONGODBURI=your_mongodb_connection_string  
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key  

CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name  
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key  
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret  
```

#### `ServiceAccount.json`

Place your `ServiceAccount.json` file in the root `MobiConnect/` directory.

>  This file is required for Firebase or Google Cloud services. Be sure to add it to `.gitignore` to avoid committing sensitive information:

```gitignore
/ServiceAccount.json
```
